Hello! Thank you for taking interest in my code!

I designed this program while working some of the specificites of my computer, and did not design in with other computers 
in mind.

To run this program as it exists in its current implementation, start running the code in whatever console/environment 
you are using, and simply begin a round of Wizard101's pet dance game. The program will input all arrows automatically. 
It will keep running until you quit the code in the console, so you can keep starting new games as you wish and it will
keep interacting with them. Future implementations could see the program automatically continuing the game to allow for 
completely automatic farming. 

Some of the code is dependent on the resolution images generated by Wizard101 as well as the coordinates of certain 
pixels on the screen. I will list the lines of code that include specific references to my computer's resolution here:
    tools.py Line 132 - Screen coordinates for arrow screenshow
    tools.py Lines 9, 27 - Loading screenshots that were originally taken on my computer's native resolution

For your information, the resolution of the computer that I developed this program on is 1920x1080, and I was running 
Wizard101 on a resolution of 1280x720. Additionally, I have my client's fullscreen setting set to 'On Borderless' (this 
does affect the size of text and symbols).If you have similar system parameters, I imagine this code would work out of 
the box for you. If you do not, here are my recommendations for getting this program to run well on your computer:
     - Turn the fullscreen setting to 'On Borderless' in your Wizard101 client
     - Replace the coordinates on Line 132 with the pixel coordinates on your computer that outline the location of the
    box containing the status of the game ('Match This!', 'Go!', 'Done!') and the arrow indicator
     - If possible, set the resolution of your Wizard101 client to match mine. If this is not possible, you may have to
    replace the screenshots in the template folder with your own screenshots


Good luck! I hope this little program is useful or interesting to you!
